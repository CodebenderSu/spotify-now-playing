# Spotify Now Playing

### About
A very simple app that uses the Spotify API to display the current track information of a specific user.

This app isn't meant for distribution currently (and probably never will be); instead it has been built specifically for my own purposes. I may or may not continue work on this project.

### Disclaimer
I used some poor practices to circumvent needing a backend server for this app (opting to run it only on my local server). As such this app should not be setup and used in a proper production environment as it will not be secure.

### Dependencies
* React JS
* React Redux
* Redux Persist
